          <p>
            Context: This sketch visualizes the minutes of work and rest for someone following the pomodoro study
            technique.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is for people who need to study on the computer and want to follow the
              pomodoro technique.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>I made the timer follow the mouse so that you wouldn't have to check a different app for the timer.
                </li>
                <li>I made the timer show for 5 seconds on click so that it doesn't interrupt any work you do.
                  I would make it a key combination though, but due to making things simple, I just did left click.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>In the context of studying on the computer, I think that being able to see how much time has passed is
                really beneficial. Pie charts are also really easy and clean to read. Being able to read the time
                quickly over the mouse, should provide great usability.
                The colors should be able to differentiate easily.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> Add a 00:00 timer under the clock.
              Have it appear only on key combo since left click is too common when working.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Context: This sketch visualizes how long a user would work then rest when doing a specific assignment and
            following the pomodoro technique.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is for users who would want to have fun with their timer but also use
              pomodoro.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>I made the images gifs for two reasons. First, because it's fun. Second, it shows action while
                  working to hopefully give some energy while you work.</li>
                <li>I made the timer a bar, similar to an HP bar like in a video game. To make things fun and easy to
                  understand. It's also why I chose green and blue for HP / Healing.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>I chose this because I wanted to have at least one “fun” design. If a timer is fun, then it would be
                more used I think. It would also make studying more fun.
                I chose the colors of green and blue to mimic that of an HP bar and healing in video games. I also
                wanted the timer to move like an HP bar.
                I chose to have GIFs also, so that the clock shows a lot of action and moving parts. This way, it might
                give some energy when watching the clock, instead of a simple analog clock.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> The original idea was for assignments to come in a queue. As soon as you
              "kill" one, then
              the next one would come up after a small break. I also wanted to add forced rest buttons or things like
              that, but I didn't have much time.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Context: This sketch visualizes how user could work, then rest out of an hour.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is for users who would want to track how long they study and rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>I made time be represented by lines because I think it's easy to understand time if it's filling
                  something. People can easily gauge 50%, 25%, etc with a line.</li>
                <li>I made the rest and work line segments be different color, so that when stacked together, you can
                  easily see which color dominates the other.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                I wanted another design that caters to those who just want to keep track of their time. This design
                allows the user to visualize their own time and not just follow the Pomodoro technique.
                I chose for rest and work to have different colors. This makes differing between them easy.
                Having a stopwatch at the top allows for a more specific sense of time. I also wanted people to be able
                to see the bar of time better. So using a clock time in 00:00:00 should make it easier to relate.

              </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> Making the segment numbers into minutes, seconds instead of minutes and
              decimals.
              I think there should be a pause button.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="sk4-narrative-title">2024 NBA Draft: Media Predictions vs. Reality</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Why did you choose the dataset and story?</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This dataset is a combination of sports media websites' mock drafts, and the real NBA draft results.
                  I chose this dataset because I was interested to see how well sports media is able to predict how the
                  draft will go.
                  Since I'm an NBA fan, I want to know what player each team might pick.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I chose this story because I wanted to know just how accurate the media is at that. Sports media
                  outlets always like to
                  push the most exciting news stories, but I think fans might want to know if they can even trust them.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Why did you choose that title for your story?</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I chose that title to first show that we're working in 2024, then the rest of it is to highlight that
                  it's a comparison.
                  The "vs." in the title hopefully shows that I want to really show how real or accurate sports media
                  is.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Is it author-driven or user-driven? What visualization genre is it?</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  User-driven: The user can change the required accuracy for correctness on a sliding scale. Users can
                  also change the source to see and compare between them. I think these interactions help narrate the story,
                  in regards to how correctness accuracy changes how well media guesses and how changing the source can influence
                  the accuracy of guesses made.

                </li>
                <li>Visualization genre: Partitioned Poster. This is the case since there is a beginning, middle, and end with all three parts playing a role in the story.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>How would you walk someone through this visualization? What is the story being
                communicated?</strong>
              <ul>
                <ol>
                  <li>Take a look at the top-left corner with the dots. You can see that 44.5% of guesses are correct. Sports media is not that great at predicting results of the draft.</li>
                  <li>Now take a look at the bottom-left corner under sources. You can see that most of the sources hover around that 40-50% range, but each source has varying results. As a result, the accuracy of draft predictions depend on which sports media outlet you look at.</li>
                  <li>Now look at the left side graph. Notice that the left side is media picks, while the right side are real draft picks. You can see that some green lines were guessed correctly, while red lines were guessed incorrectly. Among the red lines, notice how they can drop or rise up to 6, 10 spots.
                    If you were looking at a mock draft, would this be accurate enough for you?
                  </li>
                  <li>Move your attention now to the correctness accuracy slider. Move the slider to left and right. Notice how as the correctness accuracy increases, more guesses are correct, and vice versa.
                    Notice how if you just wanted to know a comfortable range that a player might get picked in, then at ± 5 accuracy, 66% is alright. This means that a player mocked at 15th is likely to between 10th and 20th.
                    Notice how if you wanted to get more accurate results, the % of correct guesses goes down, and vice versa.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <li>Story: NBA sports media mock drafts are not very accurate. On average, only 44.5% of predictions are correct when correctness is difined as the difference between mock and draft positions being less than 3.
                    Accuracy also varies a little by media outlet, usually between a 5-10% difference in accuracy. Even small differences can mean players are picked 6–10 spots away from predictions.
                    While mock drafts can show a general range — about 66% accuracy within ±5 picks — they shouldn’t be trusted for exact results. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Interview feedback (annotated slides)</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Interviewee A:</em> Noticed color contrast and ranking shifts first; quickly understood media
                  vs. reality theme.</li>
                <li><em>Interviewee B:</em> Focused on surprising pick differences; appreciated clarity of visual
                  hierarchy.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Main design principles guiding encoding choices</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Used color to distinguish predicted vs. actual picks.</li>
                <li>Represented rank differences through line slopes or position shifts.</li>
                <li>Maintained simplicity and consistent layout across axes.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>How did you ensure clarity, hierarchy, and memorability?</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Clear labels, color legends, and annotations improve readability.</li>
                <li>Hierarchy emphasized top picks and biggest changes using color and annotation size.</li>
                <li>Memorability enhanced through highlights of notable draft surprises.</li>
