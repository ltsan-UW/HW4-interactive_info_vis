          <p>
            Context: This sketch visualizes the minutes of work and rest for someone following the pomodoro study
            technique.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is for people who need to study on the computer and want to follow the
              pomodoro technique.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>I made the timer follow the mouse so that you wouldn't have to check a different app for the timer.
                </li>
                <li>I made the timer show for 5 seconds on click so that it doesn't interrupt any work you do.
                  I would make it a key combination though, but due to making things simple, I just did left click.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>In the context of studying on the computer, I think that being able to see how much time has passed is
                really beneficial. Pie charts are also really easy and clean to read. Being able to read the time
                quickly over the mouse, should provide great usability.
                The colors should be able to differentiate easily.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> Add a 00:00 timer under the clock.
              Have it appear only on key combo since left click is too common when working.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Context: This sketch visualizes how long a user would work then rest when doing a specific assignment and
            following the pomodoro technique.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is for users who would want to have fun with their timer but also use
              pomodoro.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>I made the images gifs for two reasons. First, because it's fun. Second, it shows action while
                  working to hopefully give some energy while you work.</li>
                <li>I made the timer a bar, similar to an HP bar like in a video game. To make things fun and easy to
                  understand. It's also why I chose green and blue for HP / Healing.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>I chose this because I wanted to have at least one “fun” design. If a timer is fun, then it would be
                more used I think. It would also make studying more fun.
                I chose the colors of green and blue to mimic that of an HP bar and healing in video games. I also
                wanted the timer to move like an HP bar.
                I chose to have GIFs also, so that the clock shows a lot of action and moving parts. This way, it might
                give some energy when watching the clock, instead of a simple analog clock.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> The original idea was for assignments to come in a queue. As soon as you
              "kill" one, then
              the next one would come up after a small break. I also wanted to add forced rest buttons or things like
              that, but I didn't have much time.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            Context: This sketch visualizes how user could work, then rest out of an hour.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is for users who would want to track how long they study and rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>I made time be represented by lines because I think it's easy to understand time if it's filling
                  something. People can easily gauge 50%, 25%, etc with a line.</li>
                <li>I made the rest and work line segments be different color, so that when stacked together, you can
                  easily see which color dominates the other.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                I wanted another design that caters to those who just want to keep track of their time. This design
                allows the user to visualize their own time and not just follow the Pomodoro technique.
                I chose for rest and work to have different colors. This makes differing between them easy.
                Having a stopwatch at the top allows for a more specific sense of time. I also wanted people to be able
                to see the bar of time better. So using a clock time in 00:00:00 should make it easier to relate.

              </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> Making the segment numbers into minutes, seconds instead of minutes and
              decimals.
              I think there should be a pause button.</li>
          </ul>
